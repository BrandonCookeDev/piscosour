![Piscosour: Get all your devops tools wrapped-up!](doc/images/logo.png)

# What is Piscosour?

- Piscosour gets all command line (CLI) development tools wrapped-up, creating ascertainable command line workflows. 
- Piscosour does not replace other tools, coexists with all of them and allows the best symbiosis of them all.
- Piscosour shots are easy and reusable components based on a npm dependency. 
- Piscosour execution creates an easily junit.xml filed to manage with the most popular orchestrators like Jenkins, Hudson, Bamboo, etc.
- Piscosour keeps all sets of tools ordered under the same recipe, so you could have recipes for polymer, AngularJS, react, facilities, system utilities ... and use them in any workflow you need.

We have moved the idea of a component to use it as a tool to build, to test, to use in a continuous integration tool, etc. For all these tasks we have created Piscosour.

**To get an idea, itâ€™s a command line jenkins, bamboo, travis or gocd , which allows better reuse of workflows.** 

Piscosour wraps the functionality of any tool and helps you to:

1. localize.
2. documenting.
3. share.
4. trust.
5. test.
6. versioning.
7. watch the life cycle.
8. watch results

 of all bash scripts, gulp and grunt tasks, yeoman generators, hydrolysis, lint/eslint, polymer tools, cordova tools, sass,  etc.

So, you can use all your favorites tools keeping it under control and versioned.

### Improve the docker image of a command with all the requirements inside its shots 

**Context:** Has to be executed inside a **recipe**.

- Execute 'docker run -v `${process.cwd()}:/home/pisco/workspace` {fromImage} --pstage core-check --b-saveRequirements --b-disableSystemCheck' to get the **'requirements.json'** file.

#### Dockerfiles repository

System dependencies are resolved using:
 
 1. 'dockerfile' folder inside any recipe of the dependencies inside package.json of dockersour recipe.
 2. NOTE that .piscosour/dockerfiles directory can be use as Dockerfiles repository. So is posible to use this to write addhoc Dockerfiles.
 3. NOTE: We recomend to write general Dockerfile in order to be reused in other recipes.
  
For example: if we have a requirement written in a params.json of a shot like this:

```
  "bbva-components-catalog": {
    "key": "bbva-web-components",
    "listedIn": "bower",
    "uri": "https://descinet.bbva.es/stash/scm/cat/bbva-components-catalog.git",
    "regexp": "=(.*?)"
  },
```
inside the .piscosour/dockerfiles directory we have a directory named **bbva-components-catalog**

with this Dockerfile as template:

```
FROM {{ fromImage }}
ADD {{ workingDir }}/.netrc /home/pisco/recipe
WORKDIR /home/pisco/recipe
USER root
RUN chown pisco:pisco .netrc
USER pisco
RUN mv .netrc $HOME
RUN bower install {{ uri }} -f
RUN rm -f $HOME/.netrc
WORKDIR /home/pisco/workspace
```

This scaffolding use plugin docker-chain dockerScaffold method. Data will be:

```
  {
    "key": "bbva-web-components",
    "listedIn": "bower",
    "uri": "https://descinet.bbva.es/stash/scm/cat/bbva-components-catalog.git",
    "regexp": "=(.*?)",
    "fromImage": ""
    "cmd": "bbva-components-catalog"
  }
```

#### Parameters needed:

- username: Username used to generate .netrc.
- password: Password used to generate .netrc.
- fromImage: Image used in FROM inside Dockerfile.

#### emit: 

- image: Name of the docker image generated.
- version: Used to tag docker image.

#### 4. recipe:docker-publish 'Publishing all generated docker images'
General info:

```
Contexts:  recipe
From: pisco-docker (0.3.1)
```
### Publish all the docker images generated to a registry

**Context:** Has to be executed inside a **recipe**.

- docker push to the registry. 

#### Parameters needed:

- generated: Array with all the docker images generated. if empty nothing is done.
- registry: (optional, default: docker hub is used) ip:port of the local registry to push the generated images.

#### Note for mac docker.

If you'd simply like to pass arguments to docker, add them to EXTRA_ARGS in /var/lib/boot2docker/profile. For example:

EXTRA_ARGS='
--label provider=virtualbox
--insecure-registry=10.0.0.1:5000
'
The docker process is started via /etc/init.d/docker which sources /var/lib/boot2docker/profile. $EXTRA_ARGS is passed transparently to the docker process towards the end of start().

- Install all system dependencies written inside requirements.json from Dockerfiles (*)  
- Write temporary files Dockerfile, .dockerignore, .netrc, entrypoint.sh files from template inside template directory. 
- At the and of the execution temporary files are deleted!.

#### Dockerfiles repository

System dependencies are resolved using:
 
 1. 'dockerfile' folder inside any recipe of the dependencies inside package.json of dockersour recipe.
 2. NOTE that .piscosour/dockerfiles directory can be use as Dockerfiles repository. So is posible to use this to write addhoc Dockerfiles.
 3. NOTE: We recomend to write general Dockerfile in order to be reused in other recipes.
  
For example: if we have a requirement written in a params.json of a shot like this:

```
  "bbva-components-catalog": {
    "key": "bbva-web-components",
    "listedIn": "bower",
    "uri": "https://descinet.bbva.es/stash/scm/cat/bbva-components-catalog.git",
    "regexp": "=(.*?)"
  },
```
inside the .piscosour/dockerfiles directory we have a directory named **bbva-components-catalog**

with this Dockerfile as template:

```
FROM {{ fromImage }}
ADD {{ workingDir }}/.netrc /home/pisco/recipe
WORKDIR /home/pisco/recipe
USER root
RUN chown pisco:pisco .netrc
USER pisco
RUN mv .netrc $HOME
RUN bower install {{ uri }} -f
RUN rm -f $HOME/.netrc
WORKDIR /home/pisco/workspace
```

This scaffolding use plugin docker-chain dockerScaffold method. Data will be:

```
  {
    "key": "bbva-web-components",
    "listedIn": "bower",
    "uri": "https://descinet.bbva.es/stash/scm/cat/bbva-components-catalog.git",
    "regexp": "=(.*?)",
    "fromImage": ""
    "cmd": "bbva-components-catalog"
  }
```

#### Parameters needed:

- username: Username used to generate .netrc.
- password: Password used to generate .netrc.
- fromImage: Image used in FROM inside Dockerfile.

#### emit: 

- image: Name of the docker image generated.
- version: Used to tag docker image. 
- generated: push image to this.params.generated array (if exists) with all the images generated.

### Publish all the docker images generated to a registry

**Context:** Has to be executed inside a **recipe**.

Recive this.params.generated: if is empty nothing is done, if not:
 
- all the images are re-tagged with the registry ip:port 
- docker push to the registry. 

#### Parameters needed:

- generated: Array with all the docker images generated. if empty nothing is done.
- registry: (optional, default: docker hub is used) ip:port of the local registry to push the generated images.

#### Note for mac docker.

If you'd simply like to pass arguments to docker, add them to EXTRA_ARGS in /var/lib/boot2docker/profile. For example:

EXTRA_ARGS='
--label provider=virtualbox
--insecure-registry=10.0.0.1:5000
'
The docker process is started via /etc/init.d/docker which sources /var/lib/boot2docker/profile. $EXTRA_ARGS is passed transparently to the docker process towards the end of start().

# Plugins


## context
from: **piscosour (1.0.0-alpha.7)**  [Go Index](#main-index)

### Context for the pisco execution

With this plugin you can automatically check where recipe was executed. This plugin take configuration from params and expose two method and make one pre-hook check.
 
#### How two configure repoType definitions

You can configure the repoTypes definition in all the configurations files where pisco recipes are configured [see information for pisco configuration](doc/Load_Parameters.md). 

**Is recommend to use the piscosour.json file of your recipe**

The param is called contexts, and must be a Hash with the name of the repoType as key and Array with all the rules the repo must to match.

example of piscosour.json:
```
    "params": {
        "contexts": {
            "node-module": [
                {
                    "file": "package.json",
                    "conditions": [
                        "that.version"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "file": "piscosour.json",
                    "noexists": "true"
                }
            ],
            "recipe": [
                {
                    "sufficient": true,
                    "file": ".piscosour/piscosour.json",
                    "conditions": [
                        "that.repoType==='recipe'"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "file": "package.json",
                    "conditions": [
                        "that.keywords.indexOf('piscosour-recipe')>=0"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "file": "piscosour.json"
                }
            ]
        }
    },
```

**Rules:**

Define all rules that a repoType must match. All rules not sufficient must to be satisfied.

- **file:** The path of the file relative to the root of the repoType. (for exemple: package.json for a node-module)
- **sufficient:** If this rule is matched the rest of the rules are ignored. If is not matched, the rule is ignored and the rest of rules are evaluated (default: false)
- **noexist:** Check if the file is **not** present. (default: false)
- **conditions:** Is an array with all the conditions that the file must to match. 
  1. The file must to be a correct json file.
  2. **that** is the instance of the json object.
  3. write one condition per element in your array. 
  4. The conditions were evaluated using javascript.

#### Pre-hook: Check one shot is executed in the root of any repository type.

By default, the shot behaviour is assume that repoType is mandatory, if you need to execute one shot without this check of context, use **contextFree** parameter. **contextFree** usually is used for shotd like "create" or something like that.  

only parametrized in params.json:

```
{
 [...]
  "contextFree" : true
}
```

A user command (straw) only could be contextFree if all of its shots are contextFree. If only one shot of a straw is not contextFree then the context will be checked.

**Disable this check using options in the command line**: Is possible to disable this check using this option in the command line: **--b-disableContextCheck**. Usefull for system requirements checks.

#### addon: this.ctxIs

| Param | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name | name of the repoType to test|


Use this.ctxIs to ask pisco where was executed.

```
let isComponent = this.ctxIs("component");
```

isComponent must to be true if your recipe was executed in the root of a component.

#### addon: this.ctxWhoami

Ask pisco the repoTypes of the directory where you executed your recipe.

```
let repos = this.ctxWhoami();
```

repos is an Array of types that match the place where your recipe was executed.

## stream-write-hook
from: **piscosour (1.0.0-alpha.7)**  [Go Index](#main-index)

### Intercepts any stream flow in order to be able to manage the information inside.

This way you can capture all the output of any stream and do whatever you want with it. The way to do this has two stages:

#### 1. Start intercepting the stream

At any place in yor code is posible to intercept any stream the only thing you have to do is use streamWriteHook method:

```
   let capture = '';
   this.streamWriteHook(process.stdout, function(chunk, encoding, cb) {
     capture += stripcolorcodes(chunk.toString(encoding));
   });
```

(*) stripcolorcodes() is used to deleting all coloured characters from stream. 
  
Capture will contain all from content of process.stdout

#### 2. Stop intercepting the stream.

Is necesary to do release all system resources, so do this:

```
   this.streamWriteUnhook(process.stdout);
```

### Addons:

#### this.streamWriteHook

starts the hook

| Param | Description |
| --- | --- |
|stream |Stream to be hooked |
|cb |Function to call each time chunk is append to stream |

#### this.streamWriteUnhook

stops the hook

| Param | Description |
| --- | --- |
|stream |Stream to be Unhooked |



## system-checker
from: **piscosour (1.0.0-alpha.7)**  [Go Index](#main-index)

### How to check system requirements of a piscosour command.

The system requirements are other commands that pisco needs for a pipeline execution. This plugin checks if everything is installed and ready to use by piscosour.

#### 1. Define version match (Only in the cases where could be diferent)

By default version is taken asking the command with -v and assume that command return version plain without test.

    bower -v 
    > 1.7.9

But in some cases this is not true, in this cases you can define matches inside **piscosour.json**:  

Example of piscosour.json
```
{
  [...]  
  "params": {
    [...]
    "versions": {
      "java": {
        "option" : "-version",
        "regexp" : "\"(.*?)_"
      },
      [...]
    },
  [...]
}
```

By default this is the versions defined inside core:

```
    "versions": {
      "bower" : {
        "npm": true,
        "list": "bower cache list",
        "cmdInstaller": "bower install"        
      },
      "npm" : {
        "list": "npm list -g --depth 0",
        "regexp": "\\@(.*?)\\s"
        "cmdInstaller": "npm install -g"
      },    
      "java": {
        "option" : "-version",
        "regexp" : "\"(.*?)_"
      },
      "sass" : {
        "regexp" : "s (.*?) "
      },
      "git": {
        "option" : "--version",
        "regexp" : "n (.*?)\\n"
      }
    }
```

- **key** (for example 'java'): is the command that you need inside your shot.
- **option**: (optional, default is '-v') if version is set the way to check this version.
- **regexp**: (optional) if version is on a string the way to extract only the version. Overwrite version defined on piscosour.json
- **list:** (optional) command used to get a stdout to use the regexp function in orther to get the version of the item you want to check.
- **cmdInstaller:** (optional) command used to install packages using this key (for example 'npm install -g' or 'bower install')

##### List tip

Useful when you want to check if some dependency is listed by any command. 
 
 1. Set list in version (f.i. in npm)
 2. In any other requirement set listedIn: (f.i. module: set listedIn: npm)

this pugling is going to check the version returned when the match with regexp is done.

#### 2. Define system requirements in all your shots.

The system requirements are defined in **params.json** file inside every shot.

-**requirements** All dependencies are defined inside requirements

Example of params.json:
```
{
  "requirements": {
    "polymer" : {
      "installer": "bower",
      "listedIn": "bower",
      "uri": "https://github.com/Polymer/polymer.git#v1.6.1",
      "regexp": "=(.*?)"
    },
    "generator-pisco-recipe" : {
      "installer": "npm",
      "listedIn": "npm",
      "version" : "0.0.2"
    },
    "pisco" : {
      "installer": "npm",
      "pkg" : "piscosour",
      "version" : "0.5.0"
    },
    "cordova" : {
      "installer": "npm",
      "version" : "5.4.1"
    },
    "yo" : {"npm": true},
    "bower" : {
      "installer": "npm",
      "version" : "1.7.9"
    },
    "java": {
      "version": "1.7.0"
    },
    "sass" : {
      "version": "3.1.0"
    }
  },
  [...]
}
```

This is the possible parameters that you need in order to define a system requirement.

- **key** (for example 'java'): is the command that you need inside your shot.
- **installer** (optional): package command, search inside requirements to check the cmdInstaller.
- **version**: (optional) is the minimum version that you need for the command. Overwrite version defined on piscosour.json
- **option**: (optional, default is '-v') if version is set the way to check this version.
- **regexp**: (optional) if version is on a string the way to extract only the version. Overwrite version defined on piscosour.json
- **listedIn**: (optional) use the 'list' value of this parameter in order to check if this dependency is available.
- **uri**: (optional) only apply in npm commands. Uri of the git repo.
- **pkg**: (optional) only apply in npm commands. Used when executable and pkg are different.
 
#### 3. Check if a pisco command has all system requirements satisfied

    cells component:validate --pstage core-check --b-disablePrompts --b-disableContextCheck
    
Command explanation:

- **cells component:validate**: is the pisco command that you want to check.
- **--pstage core-check**: this means that only the core-check stage is executed for all the pipeline. System requirements check is a **pre-hook** of the stage **core-check** so you have to execute only this stage.
- **--b-disablePrompts**: disable all prompts for the command.
- **--b-disableContextCheck**: disable context checks for commands that need one.

this is the result of the execution for every shot that would have system requirements defined:

```
[12:14:32] java ( 1.7.0 ) is required ->  java ( 1.8.0_65 ) impossible to parse ... WARNING!
[12:14:33] cordova ( 5.4.1 ) is required ->  cordova ( 5.4.1 ) is installed ... OK
[12:14:34] yo ( any version ) is required ->  yo is installed ... OK
[12:14:35] bower ( 1.0.0 ) is required ->  bower ( 1.7.7 ) is installed ... OK
[12:14:35] sass ( 3.1.0 ) is required ->  sass ( 3.4.19 ) is installed ... OK
```

If any system requirement is not satisfied the command will throw an error and stops...
## system-saver
from: **piscosour (1.0.0-alpha.7)**  [Go Index](#main-index)

### Write the requirements into a global file 'requirements.json'

    cells component:validate --pstage check --b-saveRequirements --b-disablePrompts --b-disableContextCheck --b-disableSystemCheck
    
Command explanation:

- **cells component:validate**: is the pisco command that you want to check.
- **--pstage check**: this means that only the check stage is executed for all the pipeline. System requirements check is a **pre-hook** of the stage **check** so you have to execute only this stage.
- **--b-saveRequirements**: tells pisco to save all system requirements in one file.
- **--b-disablePrompts**: disable all prompts for the command. 
- **--b-disableContextCheck**: disable context checks for commands that need one.
- **--b-disableSystemCheck**: disable system checks in order to avoid vicious cycle.

this is the file resulting of the execution: the mix of all system requirements for all shots.

```

  "npm": {
    "module": "generator-pisco-recipe",
    "version": "0.0.2"

## nunjucks
from: **pisco-plugin-nunjucks (0.1.0)**  [Go Index](#main-index)

This plugin renders a scaffold folder with [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html) and [metalsmith](https://www.metalsmith.io)

### pisco-plugin-nunjucks - njkRender

```
let p = this.njkRender(root, from, to, vars);
```

Where

- *root* is the root directory where origin and destination folder are placed,
- *from* is the origin folder with the scaffold and nunjucks templates,
- *to* is the destination folder,
- *vars* is an object with the vars to be replaced and used in the nunjucks templates.

and returns a Promise.

*Example*:

When the plugin is called like:

```
  this.njkRender(
	  path.resolve('./'),
		'fromPath',
		'toPath',
		{ foo: 'meow' })
	.then(
		something();
	)
	.catch( (reason) => {
		console.error(reason);
	});
```

And exists a file `./fromPath/example.html` with the content:

```
<div>
This is a {{ foo }} cat 
</div>
```

Then a new file `./toPath/example.html` is created:

```
<div>
This is a meow cat 
</div>
```
