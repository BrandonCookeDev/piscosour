### How to check system requirements of a piscosour command.

The system requirements are other commands that pisco needs for a pipeline execution. This plugin checks if everything is installed and ready to use by piscosour.

#### 1. Define version match (Only in the cases where could be diferent)

By default version is taken asking the command with -v and assume that command return version plain without test.

    bower -v 
    > 1.7.9

But in some cases this is not true, in this cases you can define matches inside **piscosour.json**:  

Example of piscosour.json
```
{
  [...]  
  "params": {
    [...]
    "versions": {
      "java": {
        "option" : "-version",
        "regexp" : "\"(.*?)_"
      },
      [...]
    },
  [...]
}
```

By default this is the versions defined inside core:

```
    "versions": {
      "java": {
        "option" : "-version",
        "regexp" : "\"(.*?)_"
      },
      "sass" : {
        "regexp" : "s (.*?) "
      },
      "git": {
        "option" : "--version",
        "regexp" : "n (.*?)\\n"
      }
    }
```

- **key** (for example 'java'): is the command that you need inside your shot.
- **option**: (optional, default is '-v') if version is set the way to check this version.
- **regexp**: (optional) if version is on a string the way to extract only the version. Overwrite version defined on piscosour.json

#### 2. Define system requirements in all your shots.

The system requirements are defined in **params.json** file inside every shot.

both requirements and npm-requirements are the same the only diference is:

-**requirements** external dependencies, never tries to install this dependencies.
-**npm-requirements** npm dependencies, this plugin tries to install dependencies.

Example of params.json:
```
{
  "npm-requirements": {
    "generator-cells-cordova-plugin" : {
      "uri" : "https://descinet.bbva.es/stash/scm/cellsnative/generator-cells-cordova-plugin.git",
      "module" : true,
      "version" : "0.0.15"
    },  
    "pisco" : {
      "pkg" : "piscosour",
      "version" : "0.5.0"
    },
    "cordova" : {
      "version" : "5.4.1"
    },
    "yo" : {},
    "bower" : {
      "version" : "1.0.0"
    }
  },
  "requirements": {
    "generator-pisco-recipe" : {
      "module" : true,
      "version" : "0.0.2"
    },
    "java": {
      "version": "1.7.0"
    },
    "sass" : {
      "version": "3.1.0"
    }
  },
  [...]
}
```

This is the possible parameters that you need in order to define a system requirement.

- **key** (for example 'java'): is the command that you need inside your shot.
- **version**: (optional) is the minimum version that you need for the command. Overwrite version defined on piscosour.json
- **option**: (optional, default is '-v') if version is set the way to check this version.
- **regexp**: (optional) if version is on a string the way to extract only the version. Overwrite version defined on piscosour.json
- **module**: (optional) only apply in npm commands. Check if a node_module is installed globally.
- **uri**: (optional) only apply in npm commands. Uri of the git repo.
- **pkg**: (optional) only apply in npm commands. Used when executable and pkg are different.
 
#### 3. Check if a pisco command has all system requirements satisfied

    cells component:validate --pstage check --b-disablePrompts --b-disableContextCheck
    
Command explanation:

- **cells component:validate**: is the pisco command that you want to check.
- **--pstage check**: this means that only the check stage is executed for all the pipeline. System requirements check is a **pre-hook** of the stage **check** so you have to execute only this stage.
- **--b-disablePrompts**: disable all prompts for the command.
- **--b-disableContextCheck**: disable context checks for commands that need one.

this is the result of the execution for every shot that would have system requirements defined:

```
[12:14:32] java ( 1.7.0 ) is required ->  java ( 1.8.0_65 ) impossible to parse ... WARNING!
[12:14:33] cordova ( 5.4.1 ) is required ->  cordova ( 5.4.1 ) is installed ... OK
[12:14:34] yo ( any version ) is required ->  yo is installed ... OK
[12:14:35] bower ( 1.0.0 ) is required ->  bower ( 1.7.7 ) is installed ... OK
[12:14:35] sass ( 3.1.0 ) is required ->  sass ( 3.4.19 ) is installed ... OK
```

If any system requirement is not satisfied the command will throw an error and stops...

#### 4. Write the requirements into a global file 'requirements.json': NOT npm-requirements.

    cells component:validate --pstage check --b-saveRequirements --b-disablePrompts --b-disableContextCheck --b-disableSystemCheck
    
Command explanation:

- **cells component:validate**: is the pisco command that you want to check.
- **--pstage check**: this means that only the check stage is executed for all the pipeline. System requirements check is a **pre-hook** of the stage **check** so you have to execute only this stage.
- **--b-saveRequirements**: tells pisco to save all system requirements in one file.
- **--b-disablePrompts**: disable all prompts for the command. 
- **--b-disableContextCheck**: disable context checks for commands that need one.
- **--b-disableSystemCheck**: disable system checks in order to avoid vicious cycle.

this is the file resulting of the execution: the mix of all system requirements for all shots.

```
{
  "npm": {
    "module": "generator-pisco-recipe",
    "version": "0.0.2"
  },
  "java": {
    "version": "1.7.0",
    "option": "-version",
    "regexp": "\"(.*?)_"
  },
  "cordova": {
    "version": "5.4.1"
  },
  "yo": {},
  "bower": {
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "sass": {
    "version": "3.1.0",
    "regexp": "s (.*?) "
  }
}
```
